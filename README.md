# Ps-Init

> **Note**: This script is intended for testing purposes and may not be the best solution for production environments. It might contain bugs and is likely not maintained regularly. Use it at your own risk.

PS-init is a PowerShell script designed to streamline the setup of PowerShell projects and scripts. It creates base files (scaffolding) essential for any PowerShell project, making it easier to get started with script development. The script is specifically tailored for PowerShell 7.

## Features

- **Scaffolding**: Automatically generates foundational files for PowerShell projects/scripts.
- **Module Management**: Provides functionality to manage PowerShell modules in a dedicated file.
- **Variable Separation**: Allows for the management of variables in a separate file, which is excluded from Git synchronization.

## Prerequisites

PowerShell 7 or higher.

## Installation
You can install ps-init directly from the PowerShell Gallery:

``` PowerShell
install-script ps-init
```

## Usage
To initialize a new PowerShell project, simply run **ps-init** in your project directory:

``` PowerShell
ps-init
```

For reprocessing an existing project with overwriting capabilities, use the -forceReprocess parameter:

``` PowerShell
ps-init -forceReprocess:$true
```
